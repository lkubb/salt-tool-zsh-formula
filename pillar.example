# Apart from the various source files, there are two independent source trees
# for user-specific configuration.
# Generally tool_zsh > tool_global.
# `tool_global` focuses on specific users, of which most values
# will be respected by all formulae in the `tool` suite:
tool_global:
  users:

      # The following is global configuration for the user named `user`.
    user:

        # Force the usage of XDG directories for this user.
        # This sets up $ZDOTDIR in XDG_CONF_HOME. Mind that currently,
        # $ZDOTDIR will be set globally. Thus, excluded users will
        # have broken config.
